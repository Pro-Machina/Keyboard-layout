# Keyboard-layout
An effort made towards finding the optimised keyboard layout using the bigram probabilities, travel time and random numbers. Algorithm used makes use of Arrhenius equation to calculate probabilities and the method is called annealing (temperature).

# Data used
The data given has two sets of arrays of dimension 27*27 numeric values. The text file named bigram-probabilities.txt contains the first set of array which has the data of bigram probabilities, and the second text file named inter-key-intervals.txt 
contains the value of movement time between two slots in miliseconds. 
 
To run the code on your system, you need to download the code and the two newly created files in the same folder. 

# About the code
The code is a file created using MATLAB.
